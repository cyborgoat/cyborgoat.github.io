LLMs are foundational models trained on vast amounts of text data. They excel at understanding and generating human-like text.

## Key Concepts

-   Transformers
-   Attention Mechanisms
-   Pre-training & Fine-tuning

## Code Example

```python
def hello_llm(name="World"):
  print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the world of LLMs.")

hello_llm("Cyborgoat")
